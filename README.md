### Passenger Transport Aircraft
The primary goal of this project is to improve the efficiency of a passenger transport aircraft by 50% as compared to the 737. The path we chose to accomplish this goal is a retractable canard design. The intention is to reduce the total surface area generating drag while in cruise, ultimately leading to less fuel usage. While we are not yet in a position to provide results on whether our design will achieve this target, the true difficulty of this project has been found in the stability considerations of variable geometry airframes. It has required compromising the static stability behavior in both retracted and extended modes to have a "reasonable" static margin in both modes. Due to this consideration, two prototypes are being made, the first to test the performance and flight test procedures of a retractable canard aircraft. The second will build upon the knowledge of the first and develop dynamic similarity by matching the static margins and ultimately providing far more accurate analysis on the **transient** condition during retraction.
